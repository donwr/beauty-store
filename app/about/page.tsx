            Garment production is an organized activity consisting of sequential processes such as
            laying, marking, cutting, stitching, checking, finishing, pressing and packaging. This
            is a process of converting raw materials into finished products. It will be difficult to
            maintain the industry if production is not, up to the mark if the preproduction phase of
            preparation of material is not properly carried out.
